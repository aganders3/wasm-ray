# Ray tracing in Rust and WebAssembly

A live demo of the current code should be available at https://aga3.xyz/wasm-ray

This is a project to help me learn more about:
* Ray tracing
* Rust
* WebAssembly (aka wasm)


Thanks to (very seriously in no particular order):
* this amazing series on ray tracing by Peter Shirley: https://raytracing.github.io
* this awesome project for the template: https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack-template
* this great tutorial for Rust + WebAssembly: https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/game-of-life/introduction.html
